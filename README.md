# Web Scraper made in Rust

Simple web scraper that's made in Rust.

It goes to a provided website, logs the URL in the most recent file in `logs/`, then checks the first link. If there's no new URL on the page, it goes back.

I do not intend to add any more features, though if you have any in mind, feel free to open an issue and tell me.
